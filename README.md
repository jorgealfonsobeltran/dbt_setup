# Project (dbt_setup)
 
# Introduction
This project is a test to use dbt from a docker image and connect it to postgres database in another docker image on this same project.
 
This project contains two images
 
### Postgres (db)
Contains a dummy database (dbt_test) and a generated table from https://www.generatedata.com/ (workers).
 
### DBT (app)
Install all packages required to use DBT, create the profiles.yml file in the user folder (/root/.dbt/) and move a dummy project in the root folder called dbt_test.
 
## Requirements
### 1. Install Docker Engine
### 2. Install Docker compose
 
## Instructions
To work with this project you have to:
1. Clone this git repo
2. Access the project from CMD or BASH
3. Edit file ./dbt_setup/dbt-working/config/profiles.yml to set up the correct local ip for your pc
4. Execute docker compose up
5. Access the app image that by default will be running
6. Access the folder dbt_test in root folder using "cd /dbt_test"
7. Execute the command "dbt run"
 
## Results
After you run the above instructions you will get a new table called managers generated by DBT.
 
To check this you can connect to your postgres image using "psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8001 -d dbt_test -U dbt_test -W" password for this example is dbt_test
 
After access you will find a new table using "\d" command to list tables
